This site was founded initially for mainland China's transgender people. However, if you would like to contribute information for the transgender individuals in your region, please feel free to do so.

## Content

Welcome to the MtF.wiki. This is a place that may provide help for some transgender women.

MtF (Male-to-Female) or transgender female refers to a person who was assigned male at birth but is a woman.

MtF.wiki is dedicated to evolving into a free, open, and consistently updated platform for the integration of transgender knowledge, offering insights into various medical information and daily life guides relevant to transgender individuals and their experiences.

The MtF.wiki is currently in its early stages of development. Various resources may have not been included, and there may even be some errors. All enthusiastic sisters are welcome to join us and contribute to the MtF.wiki project.

The original intention behind building this website is to provide a knowledge platform for the MtF community and to promote awareness and acceptance of gender transition among others.

> Never surrender to anxiety and depression, we will eventually have our place in this world.
