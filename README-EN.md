This site was founded initially for mainland China's transgender people. However, if you would like to contribute information for the transgender individuals in your region, please feel free to do so.

## Content

Welcome to the MtF.wiki. This platform aims to provide help and resources for some [transfeminine](https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Transfeminine) individuals.

MtF (Male-to-Female) or trans female, refers to individuals who were [assigned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_assignment) male at birth but identify as female. (Note: The term 'MtF' is considered outdated and questionable by some. However, it remains popular within Chinese and Japanese communities. Since this project originates from and primarily serves the East Asian community, the name has been retained.)

MtF.wiki is committed to becoming a free, open, and regularly updated platform that integrates transgender-related knowledge, offering insights into various medical information and other guides important to transgender individuals and our experiences.

Currently, MtF.wiki is still in its early stages. Various resources may not have been included, and there may even be some errors. All enthusiastic contributors are welcome to join us and commit to the MtF.wiki project.

The original intention behind building this website is to provide a knowledge platform for the MtF community and to promote awareness and acceptance of gender transition among others.
